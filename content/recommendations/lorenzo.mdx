<Recommendation> Ramon came on board as Intern on a critical time for our startup as we
didn't have just a massive amount of code to review and update, but also to come up with
new solutions for clients and products. In short time, he got up to the agile and coding
standards, managing not just to do its job but also to propose and provide new
solutions. Once asked to do step off his comfort zone he didn't pull himself back but
have embraced the challeges with a smile, helping out delivering some great tools and
solutions. </Recommendation>
