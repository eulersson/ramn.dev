<Recommendation>Working with Ramon is a real wonder. Regarding technical skills, it is
great to have a full stack profile capable of solving open fronts in any part of the
platform (deployments, frontend, backend, etc). He is definitely the go-to guy you can
always turn to for troubleshooting. Also, interpersonally, he always has a good word for
everyone, eager to help and make things move forward. Incredibly a perfectionist with
details, he is definitely a co-worker that I would take with me
anywhere.</Recommendation>
