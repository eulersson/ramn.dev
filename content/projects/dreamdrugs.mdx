# Motivation

When **deep dreaming** images began flooding the internet, I felt inspired to
create my own interface for exploring the various internal layers of these
models. Some of them produced fascinating patterns that blended remarkably well
with features in my photographs.

At the same time, I wanted hands-on experience designing a **microservice-driven
architecture** using Kubernetes, and to explore a **development
experience** where I could write backend and frontend code simultaneously,
with **hot reloading**—all while staying fully within containers.

I also wanted to set up a **code analysis and CI/CD pipeline**, experimenting
with tools like `Codecov` (tests and coverage) and `GitHub Actions` (for `Google
Kubernetes Engine` deployment), to be well-prepared in case future clients rely
on them.

That’s how this project came to life:

> An extensible **AI Psychedelic Art Generator** that captures a picture from
> your webcam and hallucinates on it using various deep dreaming
> algorithms—pluggable and extendable by design.

# Collaboration

An online magazine about art history, [Mirador de les
Arts](https://www.miradorarts.com/), discovered my generated images and invited
me to create visuals for some of their articles.
