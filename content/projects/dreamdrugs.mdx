This project (in progress) was an excuse for me to learn microservice
architecture. Itâ€™s designed to be scalable (developed using Kubernetes and
Helm). The frontend is composed by a React application served (alongside a
frontend API) by an Express server. The backend is a Python TensorFlow Flask
app running on Gunicorn. Both communicate realtime updates via a Redis cluster
installed as a Helm chart dependency. I wanted to cut down costs on Ingress by
having an array of NGINX servers on each node (DaemonSet) receiving the
requests based on repeated DNS entry names pointing at each node. I wrote so I
(or others) can plug more trained ML models and have different kinds of
hallucinations.

Architecture and design choices is discussed in:
