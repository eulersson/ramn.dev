export const meta = {
  author: "Ramon Blanquer",
  title: "Anthem",
  description: "My anthem description",
};

This is the description of anthem, it would ideally be ~one~ many paragraphs. At the moment I
am using a dummy text. This is because I am trying **MDX** from _NextJS_ to see how well it plays.

Now comes a little box with text:

```python
# First line
class Hello:
    def sayHi(self):
        print("Hello!")
```
