# Motivation

When **deep dreaming** images started flooding the internet I felt the need to
build my own interface to explore the various deep layers within, since some of
them would produce very interesting patterns that would be very well integrated
with the features in my photo.

Simultaneously, I wanted to get my hands on designing a microservice-driven
architecture using Kubernetes and exploring <Hi>development experience</Hi>
where I could write backend and frontend simultaneously with hot-reloading while
staying in containers.

Here's where I found a perfect match:

# Architecture

Itâ€™s designed to be **scalable** (developed using `Kubernetes` and `Helm`). The
**frontend** is composed by a `React` application served (alongside a **frontend
API**) by an `Express` server. The backend is a `Python` `TensorFlow` `Flask`
app running on `Gunicorn`. Both communicate realtime updates via a `Redis`
cluster installed as a `Helm` chart dependency. I wanted to **cut down costs
Ingress costs** by having an array of `NGINX` servers on each node (`DaemonSet`)
receiving the requests based on repeated `DNS` entry names pointing at each
node. I wrote so I (or others) can plug more trained models and have different
kinds of hallucinations.
