Experimental short film entirely done using `Houdini`. I wanted to explore using
soft body simulation as well as to achieve organic looking imagery.

> **Samfælni** explores different phobias in the form of early Hollywood’s

> unveiling a coordinated series of familiar shapes performing the abstract. It
> could be seen as an undesired tribute to the great choreographer Busby Berkeley.
