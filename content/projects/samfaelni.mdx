# Samfælni

Samfælni explores different phobias in the form of early Hollywood’s
extravaganza, where rejection and attraction for mystery will dance in harmony
unveiling a coordinated series of familiar shapes performing the abstract. It
could be seen as an undesired tribute to the great choreographer Busby
Berkeley.
