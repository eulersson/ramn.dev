During my time at **Efesto Lab**, I engineered full-stack tools tailored to the
real-world needs of small and medium-sized VFX studios. Mentored by pipeline
expert Lorenzo Angeli, I accelerated my growth in backend and frontend systems,
balancing software engineering best practices with production constraints.
Here’s a breakdown of the core systems I worked on:

# Ronin

![Ronin](/career/efesto-lab/ronin.webp)

**Ronin** is Efesto’s flagship project—a collaborative asset management platform
for remote teams. It blends production tracking, artist portfolios, and pipeline
publishing into one seamless tool.

## Key Features

- **REST APIs** for both Python and TypeScript clients
- **Web Frontend** to manage project timelines, status, and artist discovery
- **Desktop Client** to publish versions, manage tickets, and create assets

## My Role

- **Backend**: Refactored core logic, optimized Cypher queries for Neo4j, built
  RESTful endpoints, and wrote maintainable, Sphinx-documented code.
- **API Design**: Architected Python SDK methods for publishing, versioning, and
  file I/O, with full unit test coverage and clear developer documentation.
- **Frontend**: Solely responsible for the web app built in Angular. Implemented
  login/auth, Gantt chart views, asset galleries, and Material UI design.
- **Desktop Client**: Refined UX/UI, performed bug fixes and refactoring, and
  developed a drag-and-drop ticket assignment feature that improved usability.

# Proxy Location

![Proxy Location](/career/efesto-lab/proxy-location.webp)

A system that intelligently routes publishing output to different
drives/services based on flexible filters.

## My Role

- Engineered the filtering logic to dynamically assign publishing destinations.
- Prioritized rules to handle edge cases (e.g., component vs. task-level
  routing).
- Authored both the internal documentation and the promotional video.

# Animation Manager

![Animation Manager](/career/efesto-lab/animation-manager.webp)

Allows animators to export/import animation curves (ATOM files) as lightweight
assets—decoupling animation from rig or scene files.

## My Role

- Built the tool from the ground up, integrating it with the `FTrack`` panel UI.
- Handled curve-object name mapping and publishing logic.
- Authored user-facing documentation and created the video walkthrough.

# Efesto Submit

    "/career/efesto-lab/submit-timecode.webp",
  ]}
/>

A streamlined submission tool that replaces manual playblast processes with a
fast, LUT-aware, audio-enabled video generator powered by `ffmpeg`.

## My Role

- Debugged core ffmpeg logic and implemented audio sync and trimming features.
- Refactored the user interface for both the Maya and standalone versions.
- Built the `CLI` entry point to enable automated integration into pipelines.
- Delivered documentation and an explainer video.

# Image Publisher

![Image Publisher](/career/efesto-lab/image-publisher.webp)

Publishes and versions packages of images—textures, renders, concepts—with
built-in deduplication and reuse features to save disk space.

## Key Features

- **Regex Filtering** to batch-select images.
- **Context-Aware Publishing** using saved task selections.
- **Versioning Optimizations** to re-use unchanged assets.
- **Maya Integration** for easy import/export.

## My Role

- Enhanced the UI with visual feedback and user controls like comment boxes.
- Extended backend logic to handle advanced versioning and asset linking.
- Documented and recorded the user guide video: docs.efestolab.uk

# Docs Builder

  images={[

    "/career/efesto-lab/docs-builder-detail.webp",
  ]}
/>

A custom-built documentation generator that consolidated `Sphinx` (Python
documentation framework) outputs into a central tool dashboard.

## Stack

- **Sphinx** for API docs and tutorials
- **Jinja** templating for dynamic HTML
- **Material Design Lite** for frontend styling
- **JS** for dynamic video modals

## My Role

- Automated builds and deployments of documentation for all tools.
- Created searchable, filterable documentation pages with embedded video demos.

> A design-driven tool for packaging and reviewing output videos with burn-ins,
> branding, and contextual metadata.

## My Role

- Built Angular UI components and integrated with a Flask backend.
- Handled secure local video rendering via ffmpeg, with variable injection only (no media uploaded).
- Ensured visual fidelity using FabricJS for canvas previews.
