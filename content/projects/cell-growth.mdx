An interactive program that simulates three different types of particles that
differentiate in the way that they grow. It is intended to create visually
interesting patterns and shapes inspired by naturally occurring cellular growth.
Some particles can be infuenced by light that the user is in control of.
Therefore, the user is able to infuence the growth of the particles and create
intriguing forms and reactions within the particles. This application explores
the emergence of new patterns and structures based on different circumstances.
