# üß™ Architecture Diagram (Coming Soon)

> <Hi>**TBD**</Hi> To visualize the cloud infrastructure, service interactions,
> and data flows.

# üîå Integration & Communication

- **Slack, Google Calendar**: Integration via OAuth2 for meetings and
  notifications.
- **REST APIs**: All services expose well-documented REST endpoints.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time chat and presence.
- **AI Assistant**: Built-in NLP interface (text/voice), capable of interacting
  with APIs to automate common workflows.

# üß± Infrastructure Blueprint

All infrastructure is deployed on AWS with high availability and autoscaling
considerations:

- **Frontend & Backend**: Deployed on EC2 with NGINX reverse proxy.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS, with daily snapshots.
- **Chat & Notifications**: Redis (ElastiCache) for pub/sub messaging.
- **Video**: Janus WebRTC servers optimized for low latency.
- **Assets & Documents**: AWS S3 buckets.
- **Security**: 2FA, encrypted DB connections, GDPR-compliant storage.

# üöÄ Deployment Strategy

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Infrastructure-as-Code planned using Terraform (WIP).
- Canary deployment setup for mobile builds (Flutter ‚Üí Android/iOS).
- Pre-production staging environment with feature toggling.

# üìà Business Logic & Monetization

- **Freemium Tier**: Limited features, no billing.
- **Standard Tier**: a monthly amount per user per month yet to be decided.
- **Premium Tier**: Custom pricing for enterprise features.
- **Billing**: Stripe integration (planned), with 3% commission on processed
  invoices.

# üìä KPIs & Observability

- **Conversion tracking** (freemium ‚Üí paid)
- **User retention and churn**
- **Session heatmaps** via Hotjar
- **MRR, CAC, LTV, ROI dashboards** (future Grafana setup)

# üí° Why This Project?
