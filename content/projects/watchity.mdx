# SaaS for Video Communication

> With [Watchity](https://www.watchity.com/), you can align your communication
> with the demands of formats, channels, and immediacy in today’s video-driven
> society.

**Watchity** is a cloud-based **SaaS platform** designed to simplify video
communication for companies and brands. As a <Hi>Full Stack Engineer</Hi>, I worked
across various parts of the platform and contributed to architectural decisions
and implementation as well as leading a team of 4 engineers.

- **Studio** app for producing branded video signals.
- Interactive **landing** pages and players for live events.
- Live editing tool for **clipping** and **sharing** video feeds.

## Event Management

We focused on client customization for landing pages, email reminders, branded
forms, and access restrictions, resulting in **dynamic page generation**
tailored to each event.

## Ingestion & Mixing

We handled _RTMP_ streams from professional devices and _WebRTC_ inputs from
speakers' webcams and screen shares. I gained extensive experience in
**real-time communications** using _WebRTC_ and
[Janus](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/) as well as **media browser APIs**.

> For the video mixer, we used _Unity_. That gaves so much power to enrich the
> user's content. I was responsible for bootstrapping _Janus WebRTC_ in _C#_
> within _Unity_.

## Consumption & Distribution

**Distribution** was a key challenge—some events had hundreds of thousands of
viewers, requiring a scalable video player and efficient **live interaction**
features (chat, calls to action, etc.). I learned how to strategically cache and
memoize to ensure performance.

We supported both live and recorded video **sharing to social networks** like
_YouTube_, _LinkedIn_, _X_ (_Twitter_), and others. I led the authentication and
API integrations for those.

The player included an **interactive engagement layer** to engage the audience
with chat, reactions, quizzes, questions and answers, and calls to action. I led
a team of three for this area and improved my _DevOps_ skills by setting up
development environments and _CI/CD_ pipelines.

# Cloud-Based Solution

Our stack ran entirely on _AWS_, exposing me to infrastructure tools like
_CloudFormation_. I worked with on-demand deployments and resource optimization.

One of my proudest contributions was designing an **observability system** for
an _EC2 Auto Scaling Group_ that scaled down to zero when the job queue was
empty and scaled up when jobs were pending. This **optimization** had a tangible
impact on the company’s _AWS_ costs.

# Consultancy & Tailor-Made Solutions

Some clients required custom workflows or _APIs_. I handled both the
implementation and the creation of clear, elegant _Postman_ documentation to
reduce back-and-forth emails.
