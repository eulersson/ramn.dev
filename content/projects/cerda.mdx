# Cerda

Cerda is a utility designed to streamline the post-processing pipeline for
render farms. It provides automated transfer of rendered files from the render
farm to a specified destinationâ€”either a local disk or a linked Dropbox
account.

Additionally, Cerda includes a customizable notification system that sends
email alerts once a user-defined number of frames have been successfully
rendered. This feature helps keep you informed of rendering progress without
needing to manually monitor the process.

Features Automated file transfer from render farm to:

- Local storage
- Dropbox
- Email notifications based on completed frame count
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into existing workflows
