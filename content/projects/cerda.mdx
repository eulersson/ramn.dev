I created cerda mainly because our Universityâ€™s renderfarm had a very limited
storage and we had to manually transfer the frames from the server to our home
drives, cerda does it using (`SFTP`). I wrote it so she uploads them to Dropbox by
using their `API`. Cerda has also a feature that notifies you by email (SMTP) and
attaches some image previews (`OCIO`) so you can see if everything is alright. I
shared the project so friends could install it by `pip install cerda`.
