Cute Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. Renderfarm helper for collecting frames.

I created cerda mainly because our University’s renderfarm had a very limited
storage and we had to manually transfer the frames from the server to our home
drives, cerda does it using (SFTP). I made her so she uploads them to Dropbox by
using their API. Cerda has also a feature that notifies you by email (SMTP) and
attaches some image previews (OCIO) so you can see if everything is alright. I
shared the project so friends could install it by ‘pip install cerda’
