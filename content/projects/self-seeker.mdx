I wanted to showcase this project because we not only created a student film,
but also organized a screening event where we prepared a philosophical talk
about the creative values that can be compromised as we grow up.

It holds a lot of personal meaningâ€”during our teenage years, we often project
ideas about where we think our careers will go. But this project also carried a
deeper message: the importance of staying playful and enjoying life the way
children do. That idea still resonates with me today, which is why I chose to
include it here.

# Synopsis

A man stuck in his ways starts living strange apparitions. This will lead him
to find out the answer throughout a complex search where childhood and memory
will play key roles.

Self-Seeker draws a distinction between concepts of adulthood against
childhood's, it is a game of contrasts. The story of an adult stuck in his own
routine, in a so mechanical way that he could forget a better life. As every
person, our protagonist also had a childhood where there was simplicity,
adventure and truthful dreams. Through their memories we will dive into a world
of innocence, simplicity and creativity.
