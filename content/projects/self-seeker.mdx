# Self-Seeker

A man stuck in his ways starts living strange apparitions. This will lead him
to find out the answer throughout a complex search where childhood and memory
will play key roles.

Self-Seeker draws a distinction between concepts of adulthood against
childhood's, it is a game of contrasts. The story of an adult stuck in his own
routine, in a so mechanical way that he could forget a better life. As every
person, our protagonist also had a childhood where there was simplicity,
adventure and truthful dreams. Through their memories we will dive into a world
of innocence, simplicity and creativity.
