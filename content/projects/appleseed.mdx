> **Appleseed** is a modern, open-source, physically-based rendering engine designed to produce **photorealistic images**, **animations**, and **visual effects**. It provides individuals and small studios with a **reliable**, **efficient** suite of tools built on **robust foundations** and **open technologies**.

**Built-in Primitives**: Implemented a set of **primitive shape classes** so
there's no need to load external `.obj` files when testing, playing, or
rendering with `appleseed`. These shapes are generated using **parametric
equations** of various geometric objects, allowing for quick setup and
experimentation.

**Expression Primitives**: Extended the built-in primitive system to support
**custom, user-defined shapes** via expression-based modeling. This was done
using `Disney SeExpr`, a powerful expression language. Users can define shapes
by writing expressions that use the **surface coordinates** `u` and `v`, along
with `SeExpr`’s **built-in functions**, to generate **procedural geometry**
dynamically.
