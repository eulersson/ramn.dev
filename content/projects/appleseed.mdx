Appleseed is a modern, open source, physically-vased rendering engine designed
to produce photorealistic images, animations and visual effects. It provides
individuals and small studios with an efficient, reliable suite of tools built
on robus foundations and open technologies (from appleseedhq.net).

Built-in Primitives: implemented some primitive shape classes so that there is
no need to load any .obj for testing, playing or rendering with appleseed. Used
parametric equation of various geometric objects in order to generate those
shapes.

Expression Primitives: extended the built-in primitives to support custom user
definitions. I used Disney’s SeExpr for this. User can plug the coordinates u
and v of the plane into their expressions and also use Disney’s built-in
functions to generate any shape they want.
