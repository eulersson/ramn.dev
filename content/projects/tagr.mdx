Tagr allows small retail stores to create the price tags dynamically. It was for my aunt, who runs a sports shop and she used it for sales. She was always writting and cutting the price tags one by one, so I automated the process, she was so happy!
Basically you type in the brand name the logo gets fetched using a Logo API and it is put into the ready-to-print tags that are generated. It was an exercise for me to consolidate my full-stack web development skills.

MEAN stack project, both backend and frontend being written in JavaScript
MongoDB & Mongoose for database management
Node environment for gluing everything.
Angular for the client side logic and MVC operations
Express for serving and server side logic
Passport for authentication
Stylus for site styling
Jade/Pug for HTML templating
Gulp as task runner
Heroku for deployment (planning to use Docker cloud in the future)
