Tagr is a tool designed to help small retail stores generate price tags
dynamically. I originally built it for my aunt, who manages a sports shop and
frequently needed to create price tags during sales. Before this, she was
manually writing and cutting each tag individually. By automating the process, I
was able to significantly reduce her workload. The application retrieves brand
logos via a Logo API based on user input and integrates them into print-ready
price tags. This project also served as a practical exercise to strengthen my
full-stack web development skills.
