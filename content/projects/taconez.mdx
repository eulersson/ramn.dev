Many times, while working or meditating, the neighbor upstairs would decide to
wear high heels and stomp around the flat non-stop. **I tried** speaking to her
in a problem-solving attitude â€” even involving council mediators â€” but it didnâ€™t
work. So I had to handle the situation myself by <Hi>bouncing those sounds back
to her</Hi>. _And my meditation improved after having listened these sounds
multiplied_ ðŸ˜†

For that a fleet of Raspberry Pis in my ceiling with microphones and speakers
attached would be listening for the specific sound and replay it back to her.

## Challenges

This **AI IoT** project exposed me to writing services for a **distributed
system**, with all the challenges that entails: node synchronization, deployment
rollout, development cycles, and containerization for resource-constrained
chips. <Hi> Ansible and Docker Compose eased these processes â€” whenever I bought
a new Raspberry Pi, it took just a few minutes to get it fully integrated and
operational in the system.</Hi>

On top of that, I faced hardware and driver-related challenges with audio I/O
peripherals (microphones and speakers), especially since they were mostly
Bluetooth â€” giving me the freedom to position them more conveniently on the
ceiling.

## Deploying Neural Networks

A crucial part was learning how to take a `TensorFlow Core` model, convert it
into a `TensorFlow Lite` version, and run it on a low-spec device like a
Raspberry Pi.

## Learning and Documenting

As I came across effective development and deployment workflows, I documented
them in the [Wiki](https://github.com/eulersson/taconez/wiki) for future hobby
or professional projects. When researching, I find it helpful to stick with what
works for me â€” so others can benefit, and maybe even improve on it!

I like paving the path for anyone who might want to contribute.
